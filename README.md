Social-Q's is an social online platform where users can submit answers to popular questions or submit their own questions for others to answer. User submitted entries will be displayed in comparision to other users and categorized by answer and demographic to see where they stand in line with others. 


Social Q's is built with the MERN stack - MongoDB, EXPRESS, REACT, and NODE.

# Functionality & MVP
* User authorization: sign up and log in
* Question creation and display
* Clicking on category displays a random question from that category to the user. 
* Answering a question will instantly render a response-distribution visualization. This visualization will take into account the userâ€™s demographic. 
* Users can go to their page and see how where their responses on average stand compared to the rest of the users on the website. 
* Users can upvote or downvote a question as it appears. Higher upvoted questions will appear at the top of the questions index on future run-throughs.
